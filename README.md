# Personal_Projects
This repository contains the personal coding projects I have completed. A brief description can be found below.

This folder contains all of the files used to create an Android app of the classic TicTacToe game. The main source code can be found under app/src/main/java/com/example/MainActivity.java and app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
