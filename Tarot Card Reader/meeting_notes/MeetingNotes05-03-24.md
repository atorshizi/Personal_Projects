# Work Plan<a id="work-plan"></a>

Create stories on Sunday

Plan dev environment 

Start setting up CI/CD

- CI/CD should verify html, verify accessibility, probably run some javascript tests

Plan how we’re gonna implement our first new feature, daily fortune

involving a database, and likely an account system. 



## Story ideas<a id="story-ideas"></a>

- We want to improve the app’s accessibility and add daily fortune

* We want daily fortune to be persistent, with accounts



Stories - _A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer._
