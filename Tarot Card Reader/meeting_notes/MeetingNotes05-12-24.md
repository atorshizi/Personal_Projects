## Work Plan



1. Finish User Story 1
2. Start on user story 4 (Start on Setting up modular, robust, gpt based fortune generation)


### Daily Fortune Decision Making

maybe we could find collections of daily fortunes, we needs lots of daily fortunes if the user is gonna require potentially hundreds of unique ones

[https://github.com/ruanyf/fortunes](https://github.com/ruanyf/fortunes)

Will be a separate tab, using Javascript to switch similar to the history tab

Could ask user question about their day

Or user could simply choose from cards to reveal fortune about their day

Simple vs long fortunes.

“When you doubt your power, you give power to your doubt.”

Do we use a LLM? Open-source? Free? Robust? 

Use an LLM to generate a hundred or so premade fortunes? 

Or just generate them dynamically using a facade/pregened backups for robustness? 


## Next User Story Ideas


### User Story 4

A User logs into the fortune app, they initiate a card draw to get their daily fortune, they choose one of the presented cards and the fortune app displays a unique fortune generated on demand about what their day may hold.
