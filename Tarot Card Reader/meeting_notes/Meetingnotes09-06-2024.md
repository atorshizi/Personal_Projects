## Retrospective

## Work Plan

-   Record individual/role introduction for video

    -   longer version for private video

    -   Quick potentially group version for public video

-   Add to Challenges we faced

-   Finish ADRs

-   PR to main from dev by EOD to freeze code

-   Debug UI

-   Breakup the video into slides/parts

-   

## Public

The produce reveal and sizzle demo - show off the product as a user
would experience. Think of it like what you might do at an event to
launch a product and it has demos of features, things you are proud of,
etc. (**2-3 mins**)

Ideally show creating an account, generating fortunes, and checking
fortune history. To get a full idea of the UX

A message to your fellow SWEs in the class (**the balance of the time 5+
mins**) which goes over your tech, pipeline, repo, project experience
(pros/cons), future plans, things you wished you did, etc. Every team
member should have a moment in that video to shine about what they did.

One funny clip(could be sports or gaming) and one picture for each
person including position(backend/frontend, etc)

Workflow, explain how it works, how the backend function(Firebase API
call and cloud functions) works. Firebase client javascript -\> Firebase
Cloud function -\> FireStore Database -\> Cloud function -\> client

A message to your fellow SWEs in the class, future plans(Varun)

## Private

-   A video discussion about how to access your repo, a tour of the repo
    organization and a demonstration of making a small change to the
    repo and the completion of the build process. You may need to write
    more detailed discussion of building or onboarding the product than
    the video supports. If so create a markdown file called
    \"onboard.md\" and put it in your documentation which goes into more
    details.\
    \
    \
    info about how we deploy firebase functions setting up firebase cli
    with json api keys and deploying and testing via the emulator and
    testing suite (Torin)

-   A more involved retrospective about how your Agile practices were
    conducted and what challenges and victories the team faced. Honesty
    is the best course of action here as we are more likely to be
    lenient if we understand you are aware of what you didn\'t do well
    on the project and practices.

Make a slide about challenges

-   Conclude your video with a discussion of what things a team taking
    on your project should do next. Discuss the features not built yet,
    improvements to the build pipeline or anything else you would have
    gotten to given another quarter worth of work.
