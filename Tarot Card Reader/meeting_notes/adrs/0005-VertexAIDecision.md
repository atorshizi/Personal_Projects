# Use Google VertexAI to create tarot card readings and provide users with prompted answers.

## Context and Problem Statement

How do we produce the best tarot card readings that feel authentix and refreshing
## Considered Options

* Have pre-written prompts that we have made and have them repeat everytime.
* Use OpenAI as our AI backing to create prompts even though it may cost a little bit
* Use Google Vertex as our AI because firebase has backing for it already.

## Decision Outcome

We ended up using Google vertex because we found that it would be the cheapest option while also being able to generate responses that aren't entirely repeated. It was a learning curve ti use it at the start but we learned how and we believe it for the best.
