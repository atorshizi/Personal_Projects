# ***Workplan 2: 5/5/2024***

## **Sprint Structure:** 
- The application will be developed in five 1-week long sprints.
- Before the start of each sprint, a weekly Sprint Planning meeting will be held on Sunday. The sprint will begin immediately after the meeting. 

- Apart from the first planning meeting, this meeting will also double as time to reflect and create a retrospective on the previous sprint. A short analysis of the previous sprint will be included in the weekly meeting's notes. 

- Programmers will be assigned to user stories at the start of the sprint. They are expected to self-distribute user story tasks based on availability and domain expertise. 

- Stories are numerically ordered and tasks within stories are also numerically ordered (ex. US 2-1 is user story 2, task 1)

- Tasks and stories will be assigned the priorities High, Medium or Low. 

- Pair programming is encouraged, but not required. 

- The structure of the sprint is subject to change based on reflections from the previous sprint.

- User stories and tasks are tracked through Github issues and a project board. 

## **Sprint 1 Features & Workplan:**

- Sprint 1 will consist of only 2 user stories. We are starting with a reduced number of user stories and tasks to gauge work efficiency during the first sprint.

- Early portions of the sprint will cover refining the github repository such as the setup of issues, project boards and the CI/CD pipeline. 

- For this sprint, user story tasks are intentionally broad to provide the programmer (or pair of programmers) broader control over the implementation of a feature. This is subject to change based on reflections.  

The following are the story tasks for Sprint 1:

1. The webpage will be adjusted to scale down to mobile phones and provide a more responsive design. The following are the planned tasks in the following order:
    - Rescaling the webpage for mobile
    - Creating popups for descriptions of cards drawn on mobile

2. The login framework will be implemented.  This feature will be used as the base for a future daily fortune system, which requires the user to login daily to recieve a tarot card fortune.  The following are the planned tasks in the following order:
    - Creating a login database with Firebase Authentication
    - Implementing the backend for Firebase Authentication
    - Creating the frontend for a login page. 

- All of the tasks for sprint 1 will be assigned the High priority due to that small number of tasks. 

## Planning for Sprint 2:

- Research about Rider-Waite Tarot cards will continue during Sprint 2 to adjust the tarot card logic if necessary. 

- The webapp will have to be moved to a new domain
