# ***Workplan 3: 05/12/24***

## **Reflections from Sprint 1**:

- Slow development due to some starting troubles and some unexpected blockers due to unfamiliarity with the codebase.

- We were unable to close any stories, but all of them are close to being finished.

- We encountered some work inefficieny due to confusion about whether tasks had already been started. This can be remedied by updating the big board in a timely manner. 



## **Changes for Sprint 2**:

- Initial tasks for stories are now assigned to an individual so that there is less confusion surrounding who should start the task. Later tasks such as tests and connecting frontend with the backend will still be self-assigned. This allows for anyone to start them once the initial tasks are completed. 

- We are combining Sprints 1 and 2, so all Sprint 1 stories and tasks are carried over to sprint 2. Programmers who are still working on Sprint 1 tasks are not assigned to any Sprint 2 tasks. As a result, we do not believe this will negatively impact our ability to complete Sprint 2's tasks. 

- We will continue to assign the same priority to all tasks. 

## **New Tasks for Sprint 2**:

1. Creating Generative AI responses for a Daily Tarot Card reading:
    - Tarot card readings are much more subjective than we anticipated. 
    - In order to provide the user with a unique interpretation of the combination of cards they draw, we would like to try to leverage AI to provide a response. 
    - We will be creating fallback responses to cover for any scenario in which the AI fails (or becomes unusable/unsuitable). These responses will be provided to the user in place of the AI response.

2. Creating a new tab on the website to receive a daily fortune:
    - We intend to create the frontend for our daily login system this week.
