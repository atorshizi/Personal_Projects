# **Workplan 5: 05/26/24**

## **Reflections from Sprint 3**:
- We ran into a major blocker while attempting to implement cloud funcitons. This blocker prevented the completion of some tasks since they rely on cloud functions being setup correctly. 

- We do not want to assign new tasks while this issue is still pending. To accomodate for the extra time required for this task, we will be altering Sprint 4. 

- Tasks unrelated to our blocker were completed without any issue. 

## **Changes for Sprint 4**:
- Sprint 3 will be extended to the end of Wednesday (May 29th). The team will aim to implement cloud functions by then. If we still need more time, we will carry over the task into Sprint 4. 

- Sprint 4 will begin on Thursday (May 30th) and end one week later on Wednesday (June 3rd). Sprint 5 will either be a short sprint after this or will be merged in to Sprint 4, with new tasks being added to Sprint 4 mid sprint. 

- A new workplan will be created after the end of Sprint 3 to create new tasks.
